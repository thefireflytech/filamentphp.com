I’m a web entrepreneur and web backend developer. I’m currently working on the Swedish car-sharing startup Heap Carsharing that I co-founded. I also do freelance work from time to time. I’m a big fan of Laravel and Vue.js and I’m also a big fan of the Laravel community. I’m a big fan of open source and I try to contribute to open source projects when I can. 
I am a coffee nerd, foodie and enjoy baking sourdough bread and pizza.
